2. Product category A is the best - performing category in terms of sales and revenue.

### Limitations

I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the Omissions but even then we can still see that there is a postivie correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
